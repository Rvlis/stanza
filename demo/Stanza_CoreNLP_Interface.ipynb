To unlock these features, the Stanza library also offers an officially maintained Python interface to the CoreNLP Java library.

        "In the above demo, we explicitly called the `client.start()` and `client.stop()` functions to start and stop a client-server connection. However, doing this in practice is usually suboptimal, since you may forget to call the `stop()` function at the end, resulting in an unused server process occupying your machine memory.\n",

        "To solve is, a simple solution is to use the client interface with the [Python `with` statement](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#the-with-statement). The `with` statement provides an elegant way to automatically start and stop the server process in your Python program, without you needing to worry about this. The following code snippet demonstrates how to establish a client, annotate an example text and then stop the server with a simple `with` statement. Note that we **always recommend** you to use the `with` statement when working with the Stanza CoreNLP client interface."
